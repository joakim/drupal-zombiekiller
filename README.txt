ZOMBIE KILLER
-------------

This module kills zombies. Why? Because someone said "Bet Drupal can't kill
zombies". How wrong can you be.

Zombie killer lets you kill (reap) zombie processes on UNIX-like systems,
using either a shovel (kill -s SIGCHLD) or a sledgehammer (kill -9). In order
for this to actually work, Apache must have the licence to kill.

This project was just for fun. But who knows, it might even be useful one day.


WARNING:
You should not use this module unless you understand the consequences of
killing processes. Killing zombie processes or their parents can cause serious
trouble. So think twice before going on a killing spree!
